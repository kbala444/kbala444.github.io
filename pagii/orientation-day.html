<p>It's orientation day at Pagii.</p>

<p>You're sitting in a large auditorium next to Amar, a fifty-six year old distributed systems research engineer, imported from Egypt. He's wearing a block colored baseball hat (yellow, red, blue, green, all colors loud and unmixed like an 8 pack of crayons) with a propeller fixed to the top. He's got a navy blue Foogle hoodie to match, one size too small and fully zipped, accentuating each lump in his torso.</p>

<p>'OK PAGELINGS!'</p>

<p>The speaker is a blonde woman in her early thirties, big round eyes, eyebrows way high up on the forehead, in a permanent excitement, wide open mouth-- she can't believe what a beautiful scene this is. She's wearing the same navy blue Foogle hoodie as the guy next to you, but it's zipped 1/10th of the way up so the sides billow out over a slightly lighter blue shirt and light wash blue jeans.</p>

<p>Her enunciation of 'PAGELINGS' is 100% sincere. As if it was a normal word, as if it were in the dictionary. When, you wonder, in her seven year tenure, did the last traces of irony slip out of her 'pageling'? When will it happen to you?</p>

<p>'IT'S TIME TO DO WHAT YOU ALL CAME HERE TO DO! IT'S TIME TO BUILD! BUT HEY, KEEP THOSE LAPTOPS CLOSED, WE'RE NOT BUILDING CODE JUST YET!'</p>

<p>Amar squints, focused, quizzical, as if he's attacking a thesis.</p>

<p>'WE ARE GOING TO BE BUILDING SOME POSTERS! I WANT YOU ALL TO GET INTO GROUPS, OK, TALK TO SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO YET, OK, DON'T BE SHY, THEY DON'T BITE!&quot;  (she exhale-laughs sharply into the mic)  &quot;AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, THROUGH ~ART~, OK, THROUGH DRAWING ON THESE POSTERS, WE'RE GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHAT DOES PAGII MEAN TO YOU? OK? WHAT DOES PAGII MEAN TO YOU? ALL OF YOU ARE ROCKSTARS, OK, YOU CAN WORK WHEREVER YOU WANT, BUT FOR SOME REASON, YOU CHOSE TO WORK ~HERE~ AT ~PAGII~!. YOU CHOSE US! WHY? SHOW US! DRAW IT FOR US! GET THOSE CREATIVE JUICES FLOWING!</p>

<p>WE HAVE MARKERS, CONSTRUCTION PAPER, GLITTER, SILLY STRING... ANYTHING YOU NEED TO EXPRESS YOURSELF! GET WILD GUYS! WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE PAGII MISSION? SHOW US! SHOW EACH OTHER! AH, I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE, THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF ORIENTATION!'</p>

<p>Amar, the fifty-six year old distributed systems engineer wearing a block colored baseball cap with a propeller fixed to the top, who has just been asked to use glitter and silly string to show, pictorally, why he is passionate about Pagii, looks bewildered. You, used to this kind of thing, decide to take him under your wing.</p>

<p>'Ok Amar, I'm thinking we keep this simple. Maybe draw a big circle and say something about want to &quot;unify the world&quot;. Unify. Like a circle. That works, right?'</p>

<p>Amar stares straight ahead, unmoving.</p>

<p>'Amar?'</p>

<p>Finally, he sighs. and speaks: 'I will acquire the glitter.'</p>
