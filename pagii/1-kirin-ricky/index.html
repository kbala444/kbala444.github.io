            RICKY: KIRIN! Kirin, Kirin, Kirin. So great to finally get some time
            with you.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN: Yes, great to meet you Ricky.</span>

          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY (EYES DARTING AROUND THE ROOM, TRYING TO RECONTEXTUALIZE):
            Cool... cool, cool, cool.

            RICKY (GOD DAMNIT RICKY, YOU NEVER PREPARE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT--
            THAT&apos;S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU. LET&apos;S WING IT BABY):
            I&apos;m excited for this!
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>RICKY CLAPS EXPECTANTLY.</span>

          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            KIRIN: Uh, I&apos;m really excited to hear about my project?
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: YES! You need a project Kirin. Project. We&apos;ve got some
            great projects on this team. I&apos;m about to give you one!
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY (SILENTLY, TO HIMSELF): Come on Ricky, this man needs a
            project, give me a project.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>RICKY: Your project is... your project is...</span>

          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY (STRUCK, WIDE-EYED, ALMOST YELLING): YOU WILL BE PORTING OUR
            ~ENTIRE~ HR TOOLING MOBILE SUITE TO LOW END ANDROID PHONES FOR
            BUSINESSES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES!
          </span>

          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY (SILENTLY, TO HIMSELF): You&apos;re a god damn pro, Ricky.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN (DEVASTATED): Awesome!</span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: Super awesome, Kirin. I&apos;m really excited for you. You
            see, as a product manager, my ear is always on the pulse of *upper
            management*. And you wanna know the harsh truth Kirin? They
            don&apos;t respect us. They think, &quot;Human Resources Internal
            Tooling&quot;, and think, &quot;That&apos;s a team? What the fuck do
            they do? How much are we paying these guys?&quot; Hell, if I
            hadn&apos;t bombed my placement interviews, you think I&apos;d here?
            I belong on the Foogle Video team, Kirin, or at the VERY LEAST, News
            Feed Optimization. God!
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY (SIGHING): Whatever. What&apos;s done is done. We&apos;re here
            now. This is our team, and we&apos;ve got to make the best of it.
            And that means making upper management respect us. Our team needs an
            image overhaul.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            We&apos;ve got to think like upper management, Kirin. What do they
            want to see?
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN: I&apos;m not sure.</span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: Expansion to third world countries. Emerging markets.
            That&apos;s the new hot topic these days. Indonesia, Kirin. Now,
            I&apos;ve never been to Indonesia. I have no idea what the fuck goes
            on there. But according to our data scientists, a shit ton of them
            are using Foogle. And they&apos;re really into it. These
            guys&apos;ll spend ALL DAY on the app doing God knows what, trading
            coconuts, I guess.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN (TAKING NOTES): Wow. Got it.</span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN&apos;S NOTES:</span>
          <br />
          <span>- INDONESIA. COCONUTS?</span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: The challenge with emerging markets is they&apos;re all using
            these garbage phones on bad wifi. So all the big teams-- Video,
            Marketplace, News-- you know-- they&apos;re all racing to get their
            bloated first world software running on these tiny screens with
            spotty internet and 10 megabytes of memory or whatever, because they
            know that if their product works with these guys-- and there are
            billions of them, Kirin! Billions!-- if it works with these billions
            of super-users, their engagement will go through the roof, upper
            management will cream themselves, and they&apos;ll all get huge
            promotions.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            Now, our metrics are abysmal, Kirin. We have one hundred users.
            Pathetic. Video has two billion. TWO BILLION. And once they hit
            Indonesia... God, it&apos;ll be a blood-bath.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            KIRIN: Uh, but our team makes internal tools right? Software to help
            Pagii&apos;s human resources staff? And there are only a hundred of
            them right, right? Don&apos;t we kind of... max out at 100 users?
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: You think the Assistant VP of Internal Infrastructure is
            going to take that bullshit excuse? These guys don&apos;t care,
            Kirin. They want to see numbers. Big numbers. Write that down.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN&apos;S NOTES:</span>
          <br />
          <span>- INDONESIA. COCONUTS?</span>
          <br />
          <span>- BIG NUMBERS</span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: Visualize with me Kirin. You&apos;re an Indonesian coconut
            refurbisher. One of your employees is turning fifty three. He&apos;s
            going to die soon. Life expectancy probably ain&apos;t great out
            there. You need to find a new employee. How are you going to do it?
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>KIRIN: Ask around, I guess?</span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: These people aren&apos;t neanderthals, Kirin. Jesus. No.
            You&apos;re going to take out your 2008 Motorola ShitBrick and load
            up the PAGII HUMAN RESOURCES SUITE. You press the
            &quot;RECRUIT&quot; button, pay five grand, and BOOM-- we scrape the
            whole internet, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Blogspot, everything.
            We search the whole god damn world to assemble a list of hundreds of
            potential candidates, perfectly selected to your opening. Pay
            another five grand, and BOOM-- we&apos;ll use neural networks to
            generate a custom orientation video for your new hire. Let&apos;s
            say we screwed up and the new guy&apos;s a creep. Five grand, and
            BOOM-- generate the workplace harassment paperwork and a severance
            package. All on your crappy 2G connection.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            KIRIN: Wow. Cool. But uh, do we already know if this is possible,
            technically? Or how long all this would take? It&apos;s hard for me
            to estimate since I haven&apos;t been ramped up yet.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            RICKY: My job is to come up with the grand plan, Kirin. The
            &quot;How&quot; and even the &quot;Why&quot; are just details.
            You&apos;ll figure it out. Believe in yourself. Where there&apos;s a
            will there&apos;s a way. Just get it done by the end of H1.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <br />
          <span>
            2:48 - RICKY MAKES A CLICKING SOUND WITH HIS MOUTH AND POINTS A
            FINGER GUN AT KIRIN, LOOKS OFF TO THE SIDE, PAUSES, CLAPS ONCE, AND
            EXITS ROOM.
